Good lovin' keeps a home together
Good lovin' sure can make it right
If you never wanna be without him
It means lovin' everything about him
And that keeps your man around at night

It takes a whole lotta women to hold it together today
'Cause a lot of other women have a whole lotta time to play
You gotta be saint on Sunday morning, a devil on Saturday night
And when you love him, do it right

'Cause she's around at the corner a wrapped in fur
And you've got to be just a little bit better than her
A little bit sweeter with your morning kisses
A whole lot warmer in the night
With a whole lotta good lovin' to make everything alright

Good lovin' keeps a home together
Good lovin' sure can make it right
If you never wanna be without him
It means lovin' everything about him
And that keeps your man around at night

If you don't believe what I'm tellin' you is so
Put your man right out in the street and watch him go
Right to the arms of a woman who couldn't even hold you a light
When a lotta good lovin' would've made everything alright

If you don't believe what I'm tellin' you is so
Put your man right out in the street and watch him go
Right to the arms of a woman who couldn't even hold you a light
When a lotta good lovin' would've made everything alright
Yeah, a lotta good lovin' would've made everything alright
